# Big-Integer-Library-In-Cpp
Developed a Big Integer library in C++ to handle arithmetic operations on integers of arbitrary size(any size).  Implemented efficient algorithms for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and comparison of large numbers.
This library provides efficient implementations for handling and performing arithmetic operations on integers of arbitrary size in C++. It is designed to overcome the limitations of fixed-size integer types by implementing custom algorithms for big integer arithmetic.

Features
Supports Arbitrary-Sized Integers:

Handles integers far beyond the size limits of native data types.
Efficient Arithmetic Operations:

Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication (optimized using the Karatsuba algorithm)
Division
Comparison (e.g., less than, greater than, equality)
Custom Algorithms:

Implemented Karatsuba algorithm for fast multiplication.
Optimized algorithms for division and comparison.
Implementation Details
Addition & Subtraction:

Performed using digit-by-digit arithmetic with carry and borrow handling.
Multiplication:

Basic long multiplication for smaller inputs.
Karatsuba algorithm for efficient multiplication of large numbers.
Division:

Implemented long division for large numbers.
Comparison:

Direct digit-by-digit comparison.
Internal Representation:

Numbers are stored as strings or vectors of digits for flexibility and ease of manipulation.
